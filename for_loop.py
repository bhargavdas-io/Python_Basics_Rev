# for loops have a specific purpose: It iterates through a array/string/number and changes the value of its variable on each iteration.

#for character in ("Bhargav Das"):
    #print(character)


# In the above example, we defined for loop and gave a variable named character. Now when the loop runs,
#It will iterate each character in the provided string and the value of the variable character changes in each iteration


#Example 2

Shop_list = ["Biscuits","Bread","Sandwich","Cold Drink"]
for each_item in (Shop_list):
    print(each_item)

# Here we have created an array of items and used for loop to iterate through the whole list and print the value of each item in the list
