# A Tuple is a type of datastructure, very similar to Lists that can store information in them
#There are key differences between the two
# TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE (Once you create a tuple,you cannot change its values later)
#TUPLES ARE USED IN SCENARIOS,WHERE THE DATA WILL NEVER BE CHANGED or MODIFIED

#Tupes have () brackets

coordinates = (56,99,8)

print(coordinates)

print(coordinates[1]) #Accessing a tuple value with index
